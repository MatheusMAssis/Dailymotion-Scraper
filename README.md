# Dailymotion-Scraper

Dailymotion scraper, capable of getting all download links from a dailymotion website and then downloading them using an web downloader page. It also changes the filenames when they have been downloaded to your computer.

## About

Using selenium, this project was created to download automatically all videos from a dailymotion page. I also created this when I was procrastinating on my college projects. This project consists of three files for each process and one main file that runs them all in order.
